## Motivation

When a survey asks for written comments, it is often tedious to read through every response to extract useful information or just to get a quick summary. By using this package, responses can be quickly summarized to get a general idea of the sentiments of the comments, which can be useful such as when a PR team wants to know the overall sentiment on a company or when instructors want to know the overall sentiment on a course. The goal is to provide a quick summary that is easily interpretable by combining results from a pre-trained Python natural language processing package with the use of visualizations.

## Plots

The Sentiment Analysis Package is currently configured to run a vader sentiment analysis and generate a likert scale distribution of the surveys. Additionally it plots a wordcloud of the common words found in in the text. Here are the sample plots for reference.
