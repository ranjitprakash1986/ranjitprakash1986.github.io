It's a pleasure to welcome your to my website. I am Ranjitprakash Sundaramurthi, you can call me Ranjit!

### My story

In my career spanning a decade one thing that has remained consistent has been a thirst for learning and growth. Unfortunately, this is a characteristic that is easily lost once life starts driving your priorities.

I started my career with a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering. Post graduation, I followed my heart towards working in the Automotive Industry with Ashok Leyland as a Pricing and Product Cost Engineer. While the exposure in the corporate role was high, I sought to continue my technical growth by pursuing a Masters in Mechanical Engineering from The Ohio State University.

The Graduate Studies opened my world to technical design work in the Oil Industry. I spent close to a decade working with Schlumberger in the Product design and development of Drill Bits. While working in the fast paced Oil Industry, I often felt the Product Design process could benefit largely from the plethora of Drilling data. I discovered Data Analysis and Data Science was a skill that cross-pollinated every industry. It rekindled my interest for learning a new skill.

With a leap of faith, I applied to the University of British Columbia. While leaving industry with steady income and going back to school is a daunting, my joy knew no bounds when I was accepted to the program. Besides the learning in a diverse environment, I feed off of the energy that a University environment brings! As I continue on this journey, I wish to share my learnings and projects through this website.
